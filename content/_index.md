# Who we are?

Hello, my friend. We are Cloud Architects!! An organization created by Leandro and Patryk.  
Motivated by a passion for Open Source Projects and mainly projects that involve Cloud Computing, we created this organization. We are not maintained by AWS/GCP/Azure or any other cloud provider, but we want to share good content and knowledge about everything that involves cloud computing.
